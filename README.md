# Feathers Weaponry â€“ Master Your Combat, Manage Your Stamina!

Feathers Weaponry introduces a tactical stamina system using feathers! Every bow draw or weapon attack consumes feathers, forcing you to balance combat and endurance. Low on feathers? Suffer Weakness & Mining Fatigue, or even lose the ability to use items!

# âš” Fully Configurable!
Customize draw time, air (bubble) thresholds, and define which bows and weapons consume feathers. Works seamlessly with vanilla & modded weapons!

# Default Config: feathersweaponry-common.toml

Bow, Crossbow and Trident will drain Feathers every 15 ticks (20 ticks is a second), will drain 2 instead if the player's bubble count is lower than 4.

Any Sword or Axe will cost Feather on a successful hit.

# ðŸ”§ How to Configure:
